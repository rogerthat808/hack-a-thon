# World Map Hack-a-thon

This project is a simple web-based map interface allowing users to explore various city locations around the world.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click on different city buttons to view their locations on the map.
4. Explore different map styles by clicking on the available options.

## Features

- **City Buttons**: Click on buttons representing different cities to view their locations on the map.
- **Map Styles**: Choose between different map styles (Standard, Dark, Topo, Satellite) to visualize the map data differently.

## Libraries Used

- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/): An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

## How it Works

- The map initializes with a default view centered at latitude 35 and longitude -95 with zoom level 3.
- Various buttons trigger events to change the map view and style based on user interaction.
- City buttons set the map view to the selected city's coordinates.
- Map style buttons change the map's visual representation to different predefined styles.
